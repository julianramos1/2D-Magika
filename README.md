## The following **required** functionality is implemented:

- :white_check_mark: Debug Command: Press N to skip to next level
									Press I to regenerate health
- :white_check_mark: Make the door in world1 invisible.
	- :white_check_mark: Implement a new item that is a stick.
	- :white_check_mark: Implement a bush object for ‘world1’ that drops a random amount of sticks
	- :white_check_mark: Place a couple bushes throughout the ‘world1’
- :white_check_mark: Implement a new item and set the skeleton enemy to drop it when killed
- :white_check_mark: Implement a chest object that will open when you press 'E' in front of it and tell the player, in some way, that he has to deliver 3 'sticks' and 3 of the items previously
implemented.
- :white_check_mark: Make it possible that the player can deliver these items to the chest and the door will appear when delivered. Whichever way it was implemented it should dynamically update (it should tell the player, either at demand or constantly) how many items are remaining to be delivered. This is the first world1's quest.
- :white_check_mark: Implemented 2 new enemies
- :white_check_mark: The enemy should have an algorithm that gives it some type of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some enemies run away from the  character until it's health is low and then attacks. Others chase you from the beginning.
- :white_check_mark: Implement at least 1 new world.
- :white_check_mark: Each world should have a different set of blocks composing it, a different size, and world structure. (The map should always be a square but the solid border composing it could make it feel like it has a different shape)
- :white_check_mark: Collect at least one new item not available before
- :white_check_mark: Have at least one new quest(mission) that will let you progress to the next stage.
- :white_check_mark: Implement a "game beaten" condition and screen
- :white_check_mark: Display to the player that they died.
